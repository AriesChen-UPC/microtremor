    Parameters
    ----------
    ax : Axes
        Axes on which points are to be selected.
    initial_adjustment : bool, optional
        Allow user to pan and zoom prior to the selection of the
        first point, default is `True`.
    initial_adjustment_message : str, optional
        Message to print and display during `initial_adjustment` stage,
        default is `None` so predefined message is displayed.
    npts : int, optional
        Predefine the number of points the user is allowed to
        select, the default is `1`.
    ask_to_continue : bool, optional
        Pause the selection process after each point. This allows
        the user to pan and zoom the figure as well as select when
        to continue, default is `True`.
    ask_to_continue_message : str, optional
        Message to print and display prior to select stage,
        default is `None` so predefined message is displayed.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        Of the form `(xs, ys)` where `xs` is a `list` of x
        coordinates and `ys` is a `list` of y coordinates in the
        order in which they were picked.
