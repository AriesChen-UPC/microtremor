## About _swprocess_

_swprocess_ is a Python package for surface wave processing. _swprocess_ was
developed by Joseph P. Vantassel under the supervision of Professor Brady R. Cox
at The University of Texas at Austin.

## Why use _swprocess_

_swprocess_ contains features not currently available in any other open-source
software, including:

-   Multiple pre-processing workflows for active-source [i.e., Multichannel
Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW)] measurements including:
    -   time-domain muting,
    -   frequency-domain stacking, and
    -   time-domain stacking.
-   Multiple wavefield transformations for active-source (i.e., MASW) measurements
including:
    -   frequency-wavenumber (Nolet and Panza, 1976),
    -   phase-shift (Park, 1998),
    -   slant-stack (McMechan and Yedlin, 1981), and
    -   frequency domain beamformer (Zywicki 1999).
-   Post-processing of active-source and passive-wavefield [i.e., microtremor
array measurements (MAM)] data from _swprocess_ and _Geopsy_, respectively.
-   Interactive trimming to remove low quality dispersion data.
-   Rigorous calculation of dispersion statistics to quantify epistemic and
aleatory uncertainty in surface wave measurements.

## Getting Started

### Installing or Upgrading _swprocess_

1.  If you do not have Python 3.6 or later installed, you will need to do
so. A detailed set of instructions can be found
[here](https://jpvantassel.github.io/python3-course/#/intro/installing_python).

2.  If you have not installed _swprocess_ previously use `pip install swprocess`.
If you are not familiar with `pip`, a useful tutorial can be found
[here](https://jpvantassel.github.io/python3-course/#/intro/pip). If you have
an earlier version and would like to upgrade to the latest version of
_swprocess_ use `pip install swprocess --upgrade`.

3.  Confirm that _swprocess_ has installed/updated successfully by examining the
last few lines of the text displayed in the console.

### Using _swprocess_

1.  Download the contents of the
  [examples](https://github.com/jpvantassel/swprocess/tree/master/examples)
  directory to any location of your choice.

2.  Start by processing the provided active-source data using the
  Jupyter notebook (`masw.ipynb`). If you have not installed `Jupyter`,
  detailed instructions can be found
  [here](https://jpvantassel.github.io/python3-course/#/intro/installing_jupyter).

3.  Post-process the provided passive-wavefield data using the
  Jupyter notebook (`mam-fk.ipynb`).

4.  Perform interactive trimming and calculate dispersion statistics for the
  example data using the Jupyter notebook (`stats.ipynb`). Compare your results
  to those shown in the figure above.

5.  Enjoy!
