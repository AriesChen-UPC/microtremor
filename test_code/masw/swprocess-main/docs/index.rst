swprocess Documentation
=======================

`swprocess` is a Python package for surface wave processing.
It includes features for performing active-source surface wave
processing [i.e., mulitchannel analysis of surface wave (MASW)], 
post-processing passive-wavefield surface wave data
[i.e., microtremor array measurements (MAM)] processed using
the open-source software Geopsy, and combining active-source
and/or passive-wavefield data to calculate rigorous statistics
on the surface wave dispersion data, which account for epistemic
and aleatory uncertainty.

This package is actively being developed, so if you do not see a feature you
would like it may very well be under development and released in
the near future. To be notified of future releases, you can either
``watch`` the repository on
`Github <https://github.com/jpvantassel/swprocess>`_ or
``Subscribe to releases`` on the
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/swprocess/>`_.
